ShadcnKit comes with a pre-configured, customizable feedback system that allows you to collect and manage user feedback directly within your application. This system is designed to be easy to use, fully integrated with your project, and doesn't rely on third-party tools.

## Key Features

1. **Customizable Feedback Button**: A floating button that users can easily access.
2. **Multi-language Support**: Translations for all feedback-related text.
3. **Rating System**: Allow users to provide a star rating.
4. **Categorized Feedback**: Users can select a category for their feedback.
5. **Comment Field**: Space for users to provide detailed feedback.
6. **D1 Database Integration**: All feedback is stored in your Cloudflare D1 database.
7. **Admin Panel View**: Review and manage feedback directly in your admin dashboard.

## How It Works

1. **User Interface**: The `FeedbackButton` component renders a floating button on your pages.
2. **Feedback Collection**: When a user submits feedback, it's sent to your API endpoint.
3. **Data Storage**: Feedback is stored in the `feedback` table in your D1 database.
4. **Admin Review**: You can view and manage feedback through your admin panel.

## Benefits of the Built-in System

1. **Data Ownership**: All feedback data is stored in your own database, giving you full control and ownership.
2. **Customization**: Easily modify the feedback form to suit your specific needs.
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your existing user authentication and admin systems.
4. **Cost-Effective**: No need for expensive third-party feedback tools.
5. **Privacy-Focused**: Keep your users' feedback data within your own system.

## Using the Feedback System

To add the feedback button to your layout:

```tsx
import FeedbackButton from '@/components/FeedbackSideButton';

// In your layout component
<FeedbackButton 
  translations={props.feedbackTranslations}
  locale={props.locale || 'en'}
/>
```

## Customizing the Feedback System

You can customize the feedback system by modifying:

1. `components/FeedbackSideButton.tsx`: Adjust the UI and behavior of the feedback button.
2. `db/schema.ts`: Modify the `feedback` table structure if you need to collect additional data.
3. Translation files: Update the feedback-related translations in your language JSON files.

## Viewing Feedback

Feedback can be viewed in your admin panel. The data is fetched from your D1 database, allowing you to:

- View feedback entries
- Filter feedback by category, rating, or date
