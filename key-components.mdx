# Blog System in ShadcnKit

ShadcnKit comes with a pre-configured blog system that supports multiple languages and dynamic routing. This guide will help you understand its structure and how to use it.

## Key Components

1. **Content Management**
   - `app/content/article.ts`: Defines the structure of blog posts
   - `app/content/articles/`: Contains individual article content

2. **Routing and Pages**
   - `app/[locale]/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`: Dynamic route for individual blog posts
   - `app/[locale]/blog/page.tsx`: Blog index page

3. **Utility Functions**
   - `app/content/functions/get-all-slugs.ts`: Generates slugs for all blog posts
   - `app/content/functions/get-blog-slug.ts`: Retrieves blog posts by slug

4. **SEO and Sitemap**
   - `app/sitemap.ts`: Generates a sitemap for your blog
   - `app/robots.ts`: Configures robots.txt for search engines

## How It Works

1. **Content Definition**: Blog posts are defined in `article.ts` with multilingual support.

2. **Dynamic Routing**: The `[slug]` and `[locale]` parameters in the file structure enable dynamic routing for different languages and blog posts.

3. **Content Retrieval**: The `getBlogs` function fetches the appropriate content based on the slug and locale.

4. **SEO Optimization**: Metadata, sitemaps, and robots.txt are automatically generated for better search engine visibility.

## Customization

To add or modify blog posts:

1. Create a new file in `app/content/articles/` for your blog post content.
2. Add the blog post metadata to the `blogs` array in `app/content/article.ts`.
3. Create translations for your blog post in the respective language files (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`, `ar.json`).

## Internationalization

The blog system supports multiple languages:

- Content is stored with translations for each supported language.
- The `[locale]` parameter in the URL determines the displayed language.
- Translations are managed through JSON files in the `messages` directory.

## SEO Features

- Dynamic metadata generation for each blog post
- Automatic sitemap generation including all blog posts
- Configurable robots.txt for search engine crawling

## Usage Example

To create a new blog post:

1. Add your content to a new file in `app/content/articles/`:

```typescript
export const NewBlogPost_en = `
  <h1>Your Blog Post Title</h1>
  <p>Your blog post content...</p>
`;
// Add translations for other languages
```

2. Update `app/content/article.ts`:

```typescript
export const blogs = [
  // ... existing blog posts
  {
    id: 1,
    name: {
      en: "Your Blog Post Title",
      // Add translations for other languages
    },
    slug: "your-blog-post-slug",
    // ... other metadata
  },
];
```

3. The new blog post will automatically be available at `/[locale]/blog/your-blog-post-slug` and included in the sitemap.

By leveraging this blog system, you can easily manage and expand your blog content within ShadcnKit, benefiting from built-in internationalization and SEO features.
