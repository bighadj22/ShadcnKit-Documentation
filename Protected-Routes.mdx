title: 'Protected Routes and API Authentication in ShadcnKit'
description: 'Understanding how ShadcnKit secures pages and API routes using Logto'
---



ShadcnKit integrates Logto for authentication, providing a secure way to protect both pages and API routes. This system ensures that only authenticated users can access certain parts of your application and make specific API calls.

## Protected Pages

### How It Works

1. **Layout-based Protection**: The `app/[locale]/dashboard/layout.tsx` file acts as a gatekeeper for all dashboard routes.
2. **Authentication Check**: It uses `getLogtoContext` to verify if the user is authenticated.
3. **Redirection**: Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the home page.

```tsx
// Simplified example from app/[locale]/dashboard/layout.tsx
export default async function DashboardLayout({ children, params: {locale} }) {
  const { isAuthenticated } = await getLogtoContext(logtoConfig);

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    redirect(`/${locale}`); 
  }
  
  return (
    // Render children if authenticated
  );
}
```

### Benefits

- Centralized authentication check for all dashboard routes
- Automatic redirection for unauthenticated users
- Localization support integrated into the authentication flow

## Protected API Routes

### How It Works

1. **Authentication Middleware**: The `lib/auth.ts` file provides utility functions for API authentication.
2. **User Verification**: The `requireAuth` function checks if a user is authenticated and retrieves their information.
3. **Error Handling**: Throws an error if the user is not authenticated, which can be caught and handled in API routes.

```typescript
// Simplified example from lib/auth.ts
export async function requireAuth() {
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('Unauthenticated');
  }
  return user;
}
```

### Usage in API Routes

API routes use the `requireAuth` function to ensure only authenticated users can access them:

```typescript
// Simplified example from app/api/feedback/route.ts
export const POST = withLogging(async (request: NextRequest) => {
  try {
    const user = await requireAuth();
    // Process authenticated request
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error && error.message === 'Unauthenticated') {
      return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Unauthorized' }), { status: 401 });
    }
    // Handle other errors
  }
});
```

### Benefits

- Consistent authentication across all API routes
- Easy to implement and maintain
- Provides user information for authenticated requests

## Key Features

1. **Seamless Integration**: Logto authentication is seamlessly integrated into both page routing and API calls.
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust protection levels for different routes or API endpoints.
3. **User Context**: Authenticated routes have access to user information for personalization.
4. **Localization Support**: Authentication flows respect the application's localization settings.

## Customization

You can easily customize the authentication behavior:

1. Modify `lib/auth.ts` to add additional checks or user data retrieval.
2. Adjust the redirect behavior in `app/[locale]/dashboard/layout.tsx` for unauthenticated users.
3. Implement role-based access control by extending the `requireAuth` function.

By leveraging ShadcnKit's authentication system, you can ensure that your application's sensitive areas and API endpoints are securely protected, providing a safe and personalized experience for your users.
