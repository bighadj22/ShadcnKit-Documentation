# Seeding Your Database and Generating Schema

After creating your D1 database, the next steps are to seed it with initial data and generate the Drizzle schema.

## Seeding the Database

ShadcnKit includes a `db/seed.sql` file with initial data. You'll need to modify this file to include your Logto user ID.

1. Open `db/seed.sql` in your code editor.
2. Find the line that inserts data into the `users` table.
3. Replace the existing user ID with your Logto user ID:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, email, role)
VALUES ('your-logto-user-id', 'your-email@example.com', 'admin');
```

<Tip>
  To Create your Logto user ID, refer to the [wrangler d1 create your-database-name](https://docs.shadcnkit.com/logto-Setup).
</Tip>

Now, seed your database:

For local development:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute your-database-name --file db/seed.sql --local
```

For production:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute your-database-name --file db/seed.sql --remote
```

Replace `your-database-name` with the name you chose when creating your D1 database.

## Generating Drizzle Schema

ShadcnKit uses Drizzle ORM, which requires a schema file. While a pre-generated schema is included, you can regenerate it if needed:

1. Find your local database file:

```bash
find .wrangler/state/v3/d1 -name "*.sqlite"
```

2. Copy the path of the `.sqlite` file.

3. Generate the schema:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit introspect:sqlite --driver=libsql --out=./db --url="file:path/to/your/database.sqlite"
```

Replace `path/to/your/database.sqlite` with the path you copied in step 2.

This command will generate (or update) the `schema.ts` file in your `db` directory.

<Note>
  ShadcnKit already includes a pre-generated `schema.ts`. You only need to regenerate it if you've made changes to your database structure.
</Note>

You've now seeded your database and ensured your Drizzle schema is up to date. Your ShadcnKit project is ready for development!
