ShadcnKit uses Resend for sending transactional emails, including welcome emails to new users. This guide will walk you through setting up Resend for your project.

## 1. Create a Resend Account

1. Go to [Resend's website](https://resend.com) and sign up for an account.
2. After signing up, you'll be directed to the Resend dashboard.

## 2. Add and Verify Your Domain

<Note>
  If you're using Cloudflare for your domain, you can easily manage DNS records there for seamless integration with your ShadcnKit project.
</Note>

1. In the Resend dashboard, go to the "Domains" section.
2. Click "Add Domain" and enter your domain name.
3. Resend will provide you with DNS records to add to your domain:

4. If using Cloudflare, add these records in your Cloudflare DNS settings.
5. Wait for Resend to verify your domain (this may take up to 24 hours).

## 3. Get Your API Key

1. In the Resend dashboard, go to the "API Keys" section.
2. Create a new API key or copy your existing one.

## 4. Add Resend API Key to Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

Replace `your_resend_api_key` with the API key you copied from Resend.

## 5. Customize Welcome Email Template

ShadcnKit comes with a pre-configured welcome email template. You can customize it to fit your needs:

1. Open `components/email/EmailTemplate.tsx`
2. Modify the content, styling, or structure as needed.
3. You can also customize the email signature in `components/email/EmailSignature.tsx`

## How ShadcnKit Uses Resend

ShadcnKit automatically sends a welcome email to new users when they sign up through Logto. This is handled in the Logto webhook (`app/api/logto-webhook/route.ts`).

Benefits of sending welcome emails:
- Immediately engage new users
- Provide important getting started information
- Establish a positive first impression
- Reduce the likelihood of users forgetting about your service

<Tip>
  Resend allows you to track email opens and clicks, helping you understand user engagement with your welcome emails.

## Facebook Conversion API Integration

ShadcnKit also sends a "CompleteRegistration" event to Facebook's Conversion API when a new user signs up. This helps track the effectiveness of your Facebook ads. We'll cover this in more detail in a separate guide.

## Next Steps

With Resend set up, your ShadcnKit project is ready to send professional, customized transactional emails. Consider expanding your email strategy to include:

- Subscription confirmation emails
- Product update newsletters

Remember to always follow email best practices and comply with relevant regulations like GDPR and CAN-SPAM.
