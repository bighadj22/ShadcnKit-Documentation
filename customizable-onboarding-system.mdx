# Onboarding System in ShadcnKit

ShadcnKit comes with a built-in, customizable onboarding system that helps you gather valuable information from new users. This system is designed to be user-friendly, fully integrated with your project, and provides insights through an admin dashboard.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-step Questionnaire**: Engaging interface for collecting user information.
2. **Customizable Questions**: Easily modify or add questions to suit your needs.
3. **D1 Database Integration**: All responses are stored in your Cloudflare D1 database.
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Visualize and analyze onboarding data with charts and tables.
5. **Localization Support**: Multi-language support for global applications.

## How It Works

1. **User Flow**:
   - New user signs up
   - Redirected to onboarding questionnaire
   - Answers questions about experience, use case, etc.
   - Responses saved to database
   - User directed to main application

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Responses stored in `onboardingResponses` table in D1 database
   - Includes user ID, timestamp, and answers to each question

3. **Admin View**:
   - Dedicated dashboard for viewing onboarding data
   - Charts showing distribution of responses
   - Table view of individual responses
   - Filters and sorting options for data analysis

## Key Components

- `app/[locale]/onboarding/page.tsx`: Main onboarding page
- `components/OnboardingClient.tsx`: Client-side onboarding interface
- `app/api/onboarding/route.ts`: API route for saving onboarding responses
- `app/[locale]/dashboard/admin/onboardings/page.tsx`: Admin dashboard for onboarding data

## Benefits of the Onboarding System

1. **User Understanding**: Gain insights into your user base from the start.
2. **Personalization**: Use collected data to tailor user experience.
3. **Product Development**: Inform feature priorities based on user needs.
4. **Marketing Insights**: Understand how users find your product.
5. **Engagement**: Start user interaction immediately after sign-up.

## Customization

You can easily customize the onboarding system:

1. Modify questions in `components/OnboardingClient.tsx`
2. Adjust database schema in `db/schema.ts` if adding new fields
3. Update admin charts in `components/dashboard/onboarding/` to reflect new data points

## Data Visualization

The admin dashboard provides several charts:

- Experience level distribution
- Primary use case breakdown
- User acquisition sources

These visualizations help you quickly understand your user base at a glance.

## Extensibility

The onboarding system is designed to be easily extended:

- Add new questions to gather more specific data

By leveraging ShadcnKit's onboarding system, you can create a smooth introduction for new users while gathering valuable data to improve your product and user experience.
