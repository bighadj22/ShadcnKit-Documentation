# Creating a D1 Database for ShadcnKit

Before creating your D1 database, you need to install the Wrangler CLI. Follow these steps:

1. Install Wrangler CLI by running:

```bash
npm install wrangler --save-dev
```

2. Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account:

```bash
wrangler login
```

Now that Wrangler is installed and authenticated, let's create your D1 database:

3. Navigate to your ShadcnKit project directory in the terminal.

4. Run the following command to create a new D1 database:

```bash
wrangler d1 create your-database-name
```

Replace `your-database-name` with a suitable name for your database.

5. After running the command, you'll see output similar to this:

```
âœ… Successfully created DB 'your-database-name'
Created database 'your-database-name' at id: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "your-database-name"
database_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

6. Copy the `[[d1_databases]]` block from the output.

7. Open your `wrangler.toml` file in your project root.

8. Paste the copied `[[d1_databases]]` block at the end of your `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
# Your existing wrangler.toml content here

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "your-database-name"
database_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Your D1 database is now created and configured for use with your ShadcnKit project.
