# Stripe Payment Setup for ShadcnKit

This guide will walk you through setting up Stripe payments in your ShadcnKit project.

## 1. Stripe Account Setup

1. Create a Stripe account or log in to your existing one.
2. Switch to the test environment in the Stripe dashboard.

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Stripe API keys from the Stripe dashboard.

## 3. Set Up Products and Prices

1. In the Stripe dashboard, create products and prices that match your `constants/plans.ts` file.
2. Update `data/hardcodedProducts.ts` with your Stripe product and price IDs:

```typescript
export const hardcodedProducts: ProductWithPrices[] = [
  {
    id: 'your_stripe_product_id',
    name: 'Starter',
    // ... other product details
    prices: [
      {
        id: 'your_stripe_price_id',
        // ... other price details
      },
      // ... other prices
    ]
  },
  // ... other products
];
```

3. Update `constants/plans.ts` with your Stripe price IDs:

```typescript
export const PRICE_ID_TO_PLAN: { [key: string]: string } = {
  'your_stripe_price_id': 'STARTER_MONTHLY',
  // ... other price ID to plan mappings
};
```

## 4. Webhook Setup

ShadcnKit includes a pre-configured webhook handler at `app/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts`. To set it up:

1. Deploy your application or use a tool like ngrok to expose your local server.
2. In the Stripe dashboard, go to "Developers" > "Webhooks".
3. Add a new webhook endpoint with the URL:
   `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe-webhook`
4. Select the following events to listen for:
   - `product.created`
   - `product.updated`
   - `product.deleted`
   - `price.created`
   - `price.updated`
   - `price.deleted`
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`

5. After creating the webhook, copy the signing secret and add it to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## 5. Local Development with Stripe CLI

For local development:

1. Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).
2. Run the following command to forward webhooks to your local server:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook
```

3. The Stripe CLI will provide a webhook signing secret. Add this to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for local development.

## 6. Seed Initial Data (Optional)

If you want to seed your local database with initial product and price data:

1. Ensure your local D1 database is set up.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute your-database-name --local --file=./db/seed.sql
```

Replace `your-database-name` with your actual D1 database name.

## 7. Testing the Setup

1. Start your local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Navigate to your pricing page and attempt to subscribe to a plan.
3. Use Stripe test card numbers to simulate successful and failed payments.
4. Check your Stripe dashboard and local database to confirm that subscriptions are being created and recorded correctly.

## Next Steps

With Stripe payments set up, your ShadcnKit project is ready to handle subscriptions and payments. Make sure to thoroughly test the integration in the Stripe test environment before going live.

<Tip>
  Remember to switch to your Stripe live environment and update your environment variables with live keys when you're ready to accept real payments.
